# DeepExplorationEnsembling

A distributed DQN implementation with Thompson sampling using ensembles, incorporating Stein variational Gradient Descent https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11642 and Randomized Prior functions https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03335. Written in JAX/Haiku and Ray. Partially based on the IMPALA example in https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku.
